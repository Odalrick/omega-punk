# CyberBreak: Netraider
Pitch for a Rogue-lite Cyberpunk Nethacking Mobile Game

## Game Overview:
Welcome to "CyberBreak: Netraider", a rich blend of cyberpunk ambiance and fast-paced digital infiltration. Crafted for those on-the-go moments, this game offers bite-sized yet riveting adventures lasting no longer than your coffee break.

## Core Mechanics:
1. **localhost**:
Your personal computer is your launchpad, where you monitor your progress, customize settings, and select which programs you'll bring along based on memory limitations.

2. **Hacking Runs**:
Dive into the vast expanse of the net, encountering multi-layered security protocols. Each penetrated layer grants more computational resources, elevating your access level and enabling the summoning of more advanced programs.

3. **Programs & Management**: In "CyberBreak: Netraider", the essence of gameplay revolves around adeptly managing your active programs. As a Netraider, you need to be on your toes - summoning replacements for crashed programs, adapting to situations by deploying specialized software, and maintaining a balance between offense and defense. The digital battleground constantly evolves, and your success hinges on how efficiently you juggle these active programs.

4. **Run-based Progression**: Each run provides a dynamic challenge. As you breach deeper layers of the net, more computational power becomes available, and with it, the capability to run more advanced and demanding programs. This isn't about long-term progression; it's the per-run evolution that keeps every infiltration fresh and challenging. Adapt to the increasing complexity and wield these powerful programs to achieve your objectives.

4. **Deck Building**:
You have limited storage. This introduces the strategic element of selecting the right mix of programs for each run. Every decision matters: which programs to unlock, which to upgrade, and which to leave behind based on the mission's demands.

5. **Auto-Battler Mechanic**:
Witness the digital clash as your summoned programs go head-to-head with system defenses in real-time. Adapt on the fly, making tactical decisions based on the battlefield's ever-evolving scenario.

6. **Potential Mission Types**:

   - **Data Heists:** Delve deep into digital fortresses and extract valuable data treasures.
   - **Support Missions:** Engage in iconic runs where you provide digital support to a physical breach team.
   - **Sabotage Missions:** Plant malicious code, corrupt databases, or overload system components to cripple your targets.
   - **Defense Contracts:** Set up programs to defend against incoming threats in a tower-defense-like scenario.
   - **Ghost Runs:** Infiltrate systems to complete objectives without leaving any trace. Stealth and evasion are key.
   - **Data Rescue:** Recover lost or stolen data from corrupted or hostage-held systems.
   - **Time-Trial Challenges:** Undertake missions against the clock, where every second counts.
   - **Puzzle Locks:** Navigate through intricate digital puzzles requiring both the right programs and player intuition.
   - **Archive Hunts:** Explore ancient and abandoned servers to recover forgotten data of immense value.
   - **Capture the Flag:** Race against AI Netraiders to capture and extract valuable data.
   - **Digital Manhunts:** Neutralize, capture, or reprogram rogue AIs or programs wreaking havoc in the net.
   - **Network Domination:** Conquer and maintain control over server nodes, establishing your digital dominion.
 
7. **Rewards & Progression**:
Gain cyber currency and reputation points from your runs. Use these to unlock and upgrade programs, or gain access to challenging mission types.

8. **Short-lived Peril**:
Each run lasts just about 10 minutes, ensuring every endeavor furthers your journey in the world of Netraiding, regardless of success or failure. Plus, the game acknowledges partial successes. Should your break be cut short or a mission aborted, you'll still retain a portion of your spoils, making every minute valuable.

9. **Interface Mastery**:
Your digital workspace is both an asset and challenge. Organize and access your programs through customized layouts. But beware: clutter can lead to chaos. As players progress, they unlock enhanced UX management skills for optimized access.

10. **Paced for Reflection and Action**:
Designed as a coffee break escape, the game emphasizes thoughtful strategy over frantic reactions, balancing calming strategy with real-time challenges. For adrenaline seekers, certain missions and loadouts offer a quicker tempo.



Remember, the above concepts and mechanics represent an initial draft. As with all game development projects, features and details are fluid and subject to change based on testing, feedback, and the evolving vision of the game.
